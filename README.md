# trubs-variants
A 7 days to die mod based off Doughphunghus's original mod `7D2D-EntityRandomizer`.  We enjoyed his mod in the 18.x timeframe, but desired some additional functionality, and as such I first took on the task of converting it from perl (which I have older proficiency in) to python (which I currently use for my job and greatly prefer).  That done, it exploded from there.

> _**NOTE:** The core concept is 100% his idea -- I simply translated his code to python and then started alterations from there.  If anyone wants to send flowers and chocolates, he is the one you should be mailing them too.  However, at the time it seemed like we was not interested in continuing with it, and I have since added many features beyond his original, so there is some original content here as well._
